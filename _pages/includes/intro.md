<br>

I am [**Yinda Chen (陈胤达)**](https://ydchen0806.github.io/), a Ph.D. candidate jointly trained by the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://sist.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) and the [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), majoring in **Information and Communication Engineering**.

- 👀 My research focuses on **multimodal understanding and generation**. Initially, I explored these two directions separately—working on **representation learning**, **self-supervised pretraining**, and **efficient fine-tuning** in **computer vision** and other multimodal tasks. Now, I'm gradually moving toward a **unified framework** that bridges understanding and generation across various domains.

- 🧭 I have the immense privilege of being advised by [Prof. Feng Wu (吴枫, IEEE Fellow, CAE Academician)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5bInRDEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Zhiwei Xiong (熊志伟)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Snl0HPEAAAAJ&hl=en) at **USTC**, and working under the collaborative supervision of [Prof. Xiaoou Tang (汤晓鸥, IEEE Fellow)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qpBtpGsAAAAJ&hl=en) at the **Shanghai AI Lab**. I also have the honor to collaborate closely with [Prof. Dong Liu (刘东)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lOWByxoAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Li Li (李礼)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dEm6VKAAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Prof. Zhihai He (何志海, IEEE Fellow)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wtr6OgkAAAAJ&hl=en). Additionally, I've been fortunate to conduct research internships at **Imperial College London** with [Dr. Rossella Arcucci](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oxy2ZQoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Che Liu (刘澈)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HED_458AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra), and the **PLA General Hospital (301 Hospital)** with [Academician Qionghai Dai (戴琼海, IEEE Fellow)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CHAajY4AAAAJ&hl=en).

- 🌱 Currently, I'm a **core member** at the [Beijing Humanoid Robot Innovation Center](https://www.x-humanoid.com/), focusing on **embodied intelligence world models** and **unified models** for humanoid robots.

- 💞️ Coming from a non-traditional background with **dual bachelor's degrees** in *Environmental Ecological Engineering* and *Economics* at Xiamen University, I've always been fascinated by interdisciplinary research. During my undergraduate years, I had the privilege of being mentored by [Prof. Yuanye Zhang (张原野)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l1GMXf4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), whose passion and rigor guided me into my initial research endeavors. My journey into AI began in 2021 as an active member of [WISERCLUB](https://github.com/wise-r), a data science community that shaped my early curiosity—I'm deeply grateful to my good friend [Ziqian Lin (林子谦)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=72n5vvcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (now at Peking University Guanghua School of Management, Department of Statistics) for recommending me to this amazing community. As someone who transitioned across fields, I deeply understand the challenges of learning something entirely new, and this experience has made me incredibly grateful for every mentor and collaborator who has guided me along the way.

- 📝 Thanks to the generous guidance of my mentors and the support of amazing collaborators, I've been fortunate to publish papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hCvlj5cAAAAJ&hl=en'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ydchen0806/ydchen0806.github.io/google-scholar-stats/gs_data_shieldsio.json&logo=google-scholar&logoColor=white"></a> at conferences including **AAAI**, **NeurIPS**, **MICCAI**, **ICCV**, and **IJCAI**. 

- 📄 My CV is available in [Chinese](/docs/简历陈胤达中文版.pdf) and [English](/docs/CYD_resume_EN.pdf).

I know my talents may not match those of many brilliant pioneers in this field, but I believe in the power of continuous learning and genuine collaboration. I'm always eager to exchange ideas, seek advice from the community, and help those who are just starting their research journey. Please feel free to reach out—I'd be truly honored to connect, collaborate, or simply share thoughts about research! 🌟

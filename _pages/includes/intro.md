I am [**Yinda Chen (陈胤达)**](https://ydchen0806.github.io/), a Ph.D. candidate jointly trained by the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://sist.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) and the [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), focusing on **Information and Communication Engineering**.

- 🌱 I’m currently an **intern at Tencent IEG (Interactive Entertainment Group)** through the *Qingyun Program*, working on **TTS (Text-to-Speech) generation** and **multimodal understanding** for *Honor of Kings – Lingbao* projects.  
- 👀 My research interests include **representation learning theory**, **self-supervised pretraining**, and **efficient fine-tuning**, particularly in **biomedical image processing** and **multimodal AI**.  
- 🧭 I’m jointly advised by [Prof. Feng Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5bInRDEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Zhiwei Xiong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Snl0HPEAAAAJ&hl=en), and mentored by [Prof. Xiaogang Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qpBtpGsAAAAJ&hl=en).

- 💼 I have conducted research internships at **Imperial College London** (with [Dr. Rossella Arcucci](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oxy2ZQoAAAAJ&hl=en)) and the **PLA General Hospital (301 Hospital)** (with [Academician Qionghai Dai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CHAajY4AAAAJ&hl=en)).  
- 💞️ Before my Ph.D., I pursued **dual bachelor’s degrees** in *Environmental Science* and *Economics* at Xiamen University and was an active member of [WISERCLUB](https://github.com/wise-r), an interdisciplinary data science community. I remain enthusiastic about research at the intersection of **AI for Science**, **medical imaging**, and **multimodal learning**.  
- 📝 I’ve been fortunate to publish papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hCvlj5cAAAAJ&hl=en'><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?logo=google-scholar&logoColor=white&label=citations&query=citedby&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fydchen0806%2Fydchen0806.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data.json"></a> at top conferences including **AAAI**, **NeurIPS**, **MICCAI**, **ICCV**, and **IJCAI**.  
- 📄 My CV is available in [Chinese](/docs/cyd_resume_CN.pdf) and [English](/docs/CYD_resume_EN.pdf).  

I’m always eager to learn, exchange ideas, and collaborate with peers in the community. Feel free to reach out anytime! 🌟

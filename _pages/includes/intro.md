<br>

I am [**Yinda Chen (陈胤达)**](https://ydchen0806.github.io/), a Ph.D. candidate jointly trained by the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://sist.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) and the [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), focusing on **Information and Communication Engineering**.

- 💞️ Coming from a non-traditional background with **dual bachelor's degrees** in *Environmental Science* and *Economics* at Xiamen University, I've always been fascinated by interdisciplinary research. My journey into AI began as an active member of [WISERCLUB](https://github.com/wise-r), a data science community that shaped my early curiosity. As someone who transitioned across fields, I deeply understand the challenges of learning something entirely new, and this experience has made me incredibly grateful for every mentor and collaborator who has guided me along the way.

- 👀 My research focuses on **multimodal understanding and generation**. Initially, I explored these two directions separately—working on **representation learning**, **self-supervised pretraining**, and **efficient fine-tuning** in **biomedical image processing** and other multimodal tasks. Now, I'm gradually moving toward a **unified framework** that bridges understanding and generation, particularly in the context of **AI for Science** and **medical imaging**.

- 🧭 I have the immense privilege of being advised by [Prof. Feng Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5bInRDEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Zhiwei Xiong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Snl0HPEAAAAJ&hl=en) at **USTC**, and working under the collaborative supervision of [Prof. Xiaoou Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qpBtpGsAAAAJ&hl=en) at the **Shanghai AI Lab**. I also have the honor to collaborate closely with [Prof. Dong Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lOWByxoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Li Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dEm6VKAAAAAJ&hl=en). Additionally, I've been fortunate to conduct research internships at **Imperial College London** with [Dr. Rossella Arcucci](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oxy2ZQoAAAAJ&hl=en) and the **PLA General Hospital (301 Hospital)** with [Academician Qionghai Dai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CHAajY4AAAAJ&hl=en).

- 🌱 Currently, I'm an **intern at Tencent IEG (Interactive Entertainment Group)** through the *Qingyun Program*, working on **TTS (Text-to-Speech) generation** and **multimodal understanding** for *Honor of Kings – Lingbao* projects, exploring how generation and understanding can work hand in hand.

- 📝 Thanks to the generous guidance of my mentors and the support of amazing collaborators, I've been fortunate to publish papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hCvlj5cAAAAJ&hl=en'><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/citations-360+-blue?logo=google-scholar&logoColor=white"></a> at conferences including **AAAI**, **NeurIPS**, **MICCAI**, **ICCV**, and **IJCAI**.

- 📄 My CV is available in [Chinese](/docs/cyd_resume_CN.pdf) and [English](/docs/CYD_resume_EN.pdf).

I know my talents may not match those of many brilliant pioneers in this field, but I believe in the power of continuous learning and genuine collaboration. I'm always eager to exchange ideas, seek advice from the community, and help those who are just starting their research journey. Please feel free to reach out—I'd be truly honored to connect, collaborate, or simply share thoughts about research! 🌟

I am [Yinda Chen (陈胤达)](https://ydchen0806.github.io/), a Ph.D. candidate jointly trained by the [USTC](https://sist.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) and [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), specializing in Information and Communication Engineering. Here's a little about me:

- 👀 Passionate about representation learning theory and biomedical image processing. My research focuses on self-supervised pretraining, efficient fine-tuning, and tasks related to image encoding and compression.
- 🌱 Exploring computer science and technology at USTC. My advisors are [Feng Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5bInRDEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Zhiwei Xiong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Snl0HPEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I collaborate closely with [Dong Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lOWByxoAAAAJ&hl=en), [Li Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dEm6VKAAAAAJ&hl=en), and have conducted research internships at Imperial College London and the 301 Hospital. My collaborators include [Qionghai Dai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CHAajY4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Rossella Arcucci](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oxy2ZQoAAAAJ&hl=en).
- 💞️ Diverse academic background: double bachelor's degrees in Environmental Science and Economics, participation in the statistical research group [WISERCLUB](https://github.com/wise-r) at WISE, Xiamen University, experience in mathematical competitions, a master's in Computer Science (CS), and a Ph.D. in Electronic Information Engineering (EE). Open to collaborations in fields like remote sensing and biomedical image processing.
- I have published papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hCvlj5cAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRayeRen%2Frayeren.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international conferences such as AAAI, NeurIPS, MICCAI, ICASSP and IJCAI.
- 📄 You can find the PDF versions in [Chinese](/docs/cyd_resume_CN.pdf) and [English](/docs/CYD_resume_EN.pdf).
- 🎓 Seeking **research internship positions** in large model theory, pretraining, and efficient fine-tuning. 🙏 Happy to discuss my qualifications further. Thank you! 🌟

Recently explored the misty heights of Huangshan, the sacred temples of Jiuhuashan, wandered through Zhuhai's coastlines and Changsha's food scene. Been lucky enough to haggle in Istanbul's bazaars, ride camels in Morocco's Sahara, and get caffeinated in Seoul's trendy streets
- 🎮 **[Gaming](/docs/王者荣耀.png)**: Not just building Honor of Kings (Lingbao Project developer here!) but also crushing it as a player - rocking National Server Nezha, Golden Badge Nakoruru, and ranked Top 50 Jungler in Hefei. Let's duo queue sometime!
